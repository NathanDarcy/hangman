# nodejs_Games

This is a simple nodejs application using ejs for the front end. It is currently in development for use as a hands on learning tool for nodejs, sequelize, and express. Currently there is one game "Hangman" which has no UI styling and simply attempts to handle all game conditions.

This application requires a MySQL database connection. The script will be added to the project when completed.

TODO:
  Styling UI
  
  Implement hangman difficulty selector
