# nodejs_Games

This is a simple nodejs application using ejs for the front end. It is currently in development for use as a hands on learning tool for nodejs, sequelize, and express. Currently there is one game "Hangman" which has no UI styling and simply attempts to handle all game conditions.

TODO:
  Styling UI
  Implement sequelize
